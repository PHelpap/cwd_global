### Anomalies wrt anomaly

- calculate timeseries of moving anomalies wrt a reference; try 1420-1450 as reference, 30 year window? Use PCWD mean values
- timeseries for each region including std? 



### Gini Index for inequality

- calculate Gini index for both each epoch for every gridcell
- plot as map to show variability/ meausre of inequality or unequalness
- low number (close to 0 rather than 1) implies low inequality i.e. over time PCWD values stable for that gridcell
- Gini index is more sensitive to changes in the middle of income distribution and less sensitive to changes at the top and the bottom of income distribution (Atkinson, 1970)
